A basic wiki lookup bot for Discord.

Installation:
1) Install Python 3.4.2 or newer
2) Run the following command:
   python -m pip install -U discord.py requests cachetools
   (Linux users may have to explicitly use "python3" instead;
   in all cases, check your PATH environment variable and Python 3's
   installation path if you have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed)
3) Follow this guide to set up a bot account for your Discord channel:
   https://github.com/Just-Some-Bots/MusicBot/wiki/FAQ
4) Edit the "token" line in default.ini with the appropriate OAuth token,
   taken from the "My Apps" Discord developer page.
5) Edit the "baseURL" line in default.ini with the URL of your wiki's
   home page (minus the "index.php" part and trailing slash).

To start the bot, run the following command:
   python main.py
   (Linux users may have to explicitly use "python3" instead;
   in all cases, check your PATH environment variable and Python 3's
   installation path if you have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed)
NOTE: The config file to load can also be explicitly specified, like this:
   python main.py myconfig.ini

Once the bot is running, users can type "!wiki name" to search for something
by name, or "!wiki category name" to restrict their search to a single
category.  The shorthand aliases that correspond to a category are specified
in default.ini, and any category not listed in default.ini won't be usable
(NOTE: arbitrary categories may be supported in a future version).
